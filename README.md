# Chromatin_simulated_annealing
Warsaw University of Technology project â€œSimulated annealing simulations of chromatin based on genomic and microscopic data".

Technologies: Python, Chimera

The project focused on using "Simulated Annealing" to simulate chromosomal structures based on microscopic data. A function, g, was developed to iteratively generate structures considering factors like genome fragment distances and chromatin topological constraints. Another function, f, was implemented to assess the similarity of the generated structures to the originals using Hi-C maps and Pearson correlation.
